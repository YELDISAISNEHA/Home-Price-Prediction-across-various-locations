# Home-Price-Prediction-across-various-locations
Bangalore Home Price Prediction

This repository contains a Data Science project focused on predicting home prices in Bangalore using machine learning models. The project aims to provide insights into the factors affecting real estate prices and help stakeholders make informed decisions.

📁 Project Overview

The project utilizes real estate data from Bangalore to predict home prices based on various features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, and more. By leveraging data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning algorithms, this project offers a robust approach to real estate price prediction.

🚀 Features

    Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and process categorical data.
    Exploratory Data Analysis: Identify key trends and insights affecting home prices in Bangalore.
    Feature Engineering: Select relevant features for accurate predictions.
    Machine Learning Models: Train and evaluate models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
    Web Deployment: Integrate the model into a simple web application for user interaction (if applicable).

🔧 Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
    Tools: Jupyter Notebook
    Deployment: Flask/Streamlit (optional)

📊 Dataset

    Source: Real estate data from Bangalore.
    Size: Includes features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, total square feet, and price.

📌 Key Steps

    Data Collection: Gathered and loaded real estate data.
    Data Preprocessing:
        Handled missing and duplicate data.
        Converted categorical variables to numerical forms.
        Removed outliers to improve model performance.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Visualized price trends across various locations.
        Analyzed the relationship between area, bedrooms, and price.
    Model Training: Built and tested models, selecting the one with the highest accuracy and lowest error.
    Prediction: Provided price predictions for new data inputs.

📈 Results

    Achieved an accuracy of XX% with the best-performing model (replace XX with the actual result).
    Identified top factors influencing home prices, including location, area, and number of bedrooms.

💡 Insights

    Prime locations in Bangalore have significantly higher prices.
    Area (in square feet) is a key determinant of home prices.
    Number of bedrooms also correlates with price, but location plays a more dominant role.

🏗️ Future Improvements

    Incorporate additional features such as proximity to amenities or public transport.
    Improve model performance with advanced algorithms like XGBoost or Neural Networks.
    Develop a fully functional web app for user-friendly interaction.
